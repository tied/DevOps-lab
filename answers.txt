How would you further automate the management of the infrastructure?

- Create a Base AMI with Puppet installed using Packer
   - Register AMI in a KeyStore for easy Retrieval (probably consul)
- Create a Jenkins build pipeline
- Refactor code using Terraform instead of CloudFormation(easier tokenisation and cross platform deployment)
- Create Blue:Green environments for app deployment
- Separate App & Infrastructure management by leveraging Kubernetes or Nomad Docker Cluster
- Integration with Splunk/Elk for logging
- Upload Static Assets up to S3/CloudFront
